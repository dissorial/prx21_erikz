- The features you selected above all play a different role in our model. Some features influence the model and thus its output greatly, while others may have no influence at all. How important to the model they are depends on a number of factors, some of which you can configure above. Here, the importance of each features is visualized in the chart (larger number=more important). Think of importances like coefficients of independent variables in a regression problem.
