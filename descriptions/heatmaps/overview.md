## What the heatmaps show

Next to each heatmap, there's a colored legend with number labels. These numbers represent the count of values at the intersection of any point in the heatmap.

- In the monthly heatmap, the minimum value in each row is 0, and the maximum value is the number of days in that month
- In the weekly heatmap, the minimum value in each row is 0, and the maximum value is 7
  - The y-axis in the weekly heatmap shows week numbers

**Example**: Plot `Sleep` in the monthly heatmap. The square at the intersection of `May` and `07:30` is bright yellow, which is a number larger than 20 on the legend. This means that in May, there were more than 20 days where I was alseep at 07:30. The same logic applies for the weekly heatmap.
