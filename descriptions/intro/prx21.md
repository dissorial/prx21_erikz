# PRX21

In December 2020, I made a New Year's resolution: **starting with January 1st 2021, I would attempt to track all kinds of data about myself on a daily basis**. I divided the data into two major groups: _time tracking_ and _quantified self (QS)_. The _thought_ of doing this didn't seem to require a significant time investment on my side, and the ability to see your year/month/week/day summarized in a chart or table could prove helpful in uncovering otherwise hidden relationships about how I function, feel or think.

- **Time tracking**: I divided days into 30-minute intervals and assigned each one of 15 pre-defined time categories, such as sleep, internet, fun, hobbies, and more
- **Quantified self**: I came up with a handful of variables&mdash;such as mood, restfulness or productivity&mdash;and assigned each a score in the range of 1 to 5
