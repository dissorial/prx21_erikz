Here, the scale of 1 to 5 simply represented how (un)healthy I deemed a particular dish to be.

**Anticipated QnA**:

> _How do you decide whether something is healthy or not?_

- Mostly as a ratio of calorie amount to nutrient value. A can of condensed milk is calorie-dense (to put it mildly) but it's all mostly sugar (i.e., a low nutrient value), so eating this for lunch (?) would get a score of 1
  > _Do you keep a list of particular ingredients/dishes that have a score assigned to them?_
- No. _Freestyle_
  > > _Wouldn't that be a good way to lower the variance of scores assigned to similar groups of food?_
  - Perhaps. On the other hand, the list of different foods I eat isn't too large and doesn't change often
