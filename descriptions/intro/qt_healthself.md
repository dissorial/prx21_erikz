I decided to use a Likert scale for these variables, which is a common psychometric scale typically used in research that involves a questionnaire. I deemed this a resonable choice given that a Likert scale is a bipolar scaling method that measures either a positive, negative or neutral response to a statement. In my case, the scale ranged from 1 to 5 (1=Terrible, 5=Great).

In typical Likert scales of this range, `3` represents a neutral option &ndash; I decided to treat `3` as something that was neither great nor terrible. It's similar to someone asking: how would you rate this food on a scale from 1 to 10? A response of `5` would indicate the good was "okay" rather than "neutral" or "I can't decide".

#### Examples

`Health` example: `headache` variable assigned a score of 4 meant I had minor complications (a very weak headache or one that didn't last long)

`Self-related` example: `restfulness` variable assigned a score of 1 meant I was extremely tired and/or sleep deprived, whereas a score of 5 meant I felt fully rested.
