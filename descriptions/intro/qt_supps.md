This category doesn't employ the aforementioned 1-5 scale. For any particular supplement, I decided to simply write the number of pills/tabs I took (dosage in case it's a poweder supplement) instead of the dosage in grams or milligrams for two reasons:

- Once I derive relationships between data (taking X mg of supplement Y leads to increase in variable Z), it's easier to translate these relationships into actionable steps
- As opposed to keeping track of dosage in weight, it's equally easy to see whether I took (or didn't take) the recommended daily allowance because I have a sheet with information on the amount of the active substance in each tab/pill for every supplement
