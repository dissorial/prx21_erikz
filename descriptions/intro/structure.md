# What can I find on this web application?

This web application is divided into two parts: **interactive visualizations** and **predictive algorithms**. Each subsection has a dedicated page to it, all of which you can find on the sidebar menu. For all datasets used here, I removed some of the variables I tracked simply because they're too personal for me to share with anyone on the internet.

> _What variables did you remove?_

- This differs for each subsection. I tried to make everything here as interactive as possible, so you should be able to see what variables are available once you navigate to a specific page.

## Interactive visualizations

- Line charts
- Ridgeline plots
- Heatmaps
- Scatterplots
- K-means clustering

## Predictive models

- Decision tree classifier
- CN2 rule induction
- Support vector machine
- Multiple linear regression
- K-nearest neighbors
