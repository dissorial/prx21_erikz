Excel layout: each row represented one day, while each column represented a single 30-minute interval.

I then defined 15 groups that I would use to categorize each 30-minute interval:

> **sleep, exercise, work, entertainment, food, hygiene, cleaning, social, college, internet, hobbies, travel, tasks, fun, and wasted time**

Each category was then assigned a two-letter code (`sleep=sl`,`internet=in`,`hobbies=ho`, etc.), which I would then write inside individual cells for each day.

For purposes of convenience, I also set conditional color formatting for each category so that it's easier to navigate and plot the data in later stages. If you'd like to see how this worked in practice, take a look at the section below.
