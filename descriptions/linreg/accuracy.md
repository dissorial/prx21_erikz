- The main reason I'm using the segmented dataset is to prevent creating a model that doesn't tell me more than what I could figure out using a calculator. If I were to use the original dataset&mdash;where each day is 24h long&mdash;predicting the value for any time variable would be straightforward. Since all time variables have to sum to 24 hours, the predicted target value must equal `24 - sum(all time variables except for target)`. In the segmented dataset, this doesn't hold true because the day length is simply defined by how long I stay up, meaning there's no fixed value. Nevertheless, both the variance and range in day length here are fairly small, and the model will be overfitted. Unless I figure out something better, the only solution is to simply remove some time variables from the features to leave the model more room for error
