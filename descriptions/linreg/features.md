- As opposed to target variables, I decided to make all variables from the dataset available as features because you can't see their actual values.
  If you're saying there's too many features available for something like multiple linear regression, I'd agree. I'm planning to implement a section for feature selection based on some critera (info gain, gini, univariate regression, etc.) in the future
