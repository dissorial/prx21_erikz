- If you look at the list of variables to predict you can choose from, you'll see a few from the `time` and `QS` category. I limited the selection here because whichever variable you choose as a `target`, its actual values will be displayed in the chart of `predicted vs. actual values` below. As mention elsewhere, there's only so much personal data I'm willing to share, hence the limitation

- The variable `sleep` isn't in the list because I'm using the transformed `segmented` dataset, meaning that each row (day) shows how much I slept on that day (as opposed to the next day). Thus predicting `sleep` in this model would mean predicting how much I slept on a particular day given everything I did _after_ I woke up, which doesn't make sense. The solution is just shifting all data points for `sleep` 1 day forward, but I'll leave that for some future updates
