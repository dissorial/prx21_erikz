# What is a ridgeplot?

- A ridgeline plot shows the distribution of some numeric values for multiple groups
- In this case, the `value` is one of the variables I track (which you can select on the sidebar), and each `group` is a different month
- The distributions can be shown using either histograms or density plots. This chart utilizes the `Gaussian kernel density estimation` for the probability density function
